You are an epxert in video game and website design
You need to build a website for an EPFL association that's called game star
The goal of the website is to present the association, it's activities and give a way to student to join us
We are a comitee of 6 persons, the website should include image and small description of us
The student in EPFL will be technical engeneers and are between 17 and 25 years old
We do multiple events such as : 
ICeLAN
Problem solving in video game
Couch project
and more 
It's important that the site is in 2 languages, has a dark and light mode and is responsive
Use only html css and maybe js but no extra plugins, the site must be fully responsive
This is the graphical chart that you should use for the website
